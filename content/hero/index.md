I'm an India based developer with a goal-driven creative mindset and passion for learning and innovating.

Currently working as a Software Engineer in the Backend Development team at <a href="https://bridgesgi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> Bridge Solutions Group</a>, India. 

Outside work, I love to read and enhance my knowledge on Data Structures, Algorithms and System Design. I like Problem Solving a lot and I love to code on Competitive Coding Platforms like <a href="https://leetcode.com/striververma/" target="_blank">LeetCode</a> and <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/ra1611008010402" target="_blank">Hackerrank</a>.
